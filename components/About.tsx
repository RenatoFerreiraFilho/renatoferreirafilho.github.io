                    With experience in <strong>React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, Node.js, SQL and MongoDB </strong>, I focus on building scalable and secure applications. I enjoy problem-solving and

                    Outside of coding, I like to spend time with my family, relax watching series, and occasionally travel to explore new places. I appreciate a good balance between continuous
                    learning, professional growth, and enjoying the simple moments in life.
